## 210 - Dev Blog

### Introduction

Hello! I am Yusuf Corr and this is my blog. I hope that my progress as a self-taught engineer inspires all who choose to focus on developing as a career and a craft.

### Format

The format of this blog is to post daily updates of my progress in a couple of areas. Leet Code problems, AI knowledge, and personal projects/interest. Thus there will be times where the code for the day is limited but on project days, my goal is to hit 210 lines for that day.
