### **Today's Notes:** 

Today's goals are to create automated blog template generation and continue to study for technical interviews. Today's ADT/Algo implementation will be *Quick Sort* (though I'll need to watch a video because I completely forgot the steps). In addition to that, I will be studying *Greedy Algo's* and trying to complete the Leet Code problem [45. Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=greedy).

I also created some simple files to automate this blog. Going to add more to that each week.

### **Tommorow's Goals:**

I did not get *Quick Sort* today. Monday (9/23) will be focusing on this (didn't even have time to do the Leet Code problem). Both will be the focus of Monday. At the end of the day, have a good week and keep making progress. You are already steps ahead in the right direction!

Enjoy the weekend!
