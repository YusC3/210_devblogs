### **Today's Notes:** 

(Leet Code) Today's goals are, once again, to focus on Leet Code! In particular, I am looking to conqure Dynamic Programming questions (DP). I've always struggled with these types of problems and as of recently, I've strated to get the hang of Greedy Algo's [see September 16th's blog](../16_sept/README.md). Out side of practicing/learning DP problems, I will also focus on implementing *Merge Sort*, an algo that I've not quite practiced enough.

### **Tommorow's Goals:**

Since I was able to implement the *Merge Sort* fairly well, tomorrow I will focus on an different ADT or algo (haven't decided yet), and continue to work with Leet Code problem [45. Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=greedy). I was able to past many test cases with this first attempt, but I need to get it down and move quicker towards the solution. Good work today. See you all tomorrow!
