### **Today's Notes:** 

Today was tough. I wanted to start a project using Griptape and OpenAI, but OpenAI changed a lot of its inner workings. You have to pay to access endpoints. Oh well. I ended up being able to at least experiement with some of the basic parameters for Grip tape as well as go through the documentation. For now, HuggingFace and OpenLLM will be how I approach utilizing LLMs. 

Python, how I love you, but these installs have to choose a place to settle down. I had serveral version tucked away, hidden in the Backrooms of my directories, a true nightmare to clean up (<.>).

I've learned a thing or two about how to work with environment variables. I recommend using either Powershell OR CMD (Command Prompt) to access/set environment variables (makes the process sooooo much smoother).

### **Monday's Goals:**

On Monday (16-9-2024), project wise, I hope to focus on using Tensor (or Pytorch) to create a simple page tracking phone app to keep tabs on where I am in a book. An extension is to add AR to view a "digital bookmark" through a live camera feed (how fun :)).

I'll be moving away from OpenAI for now and focusing on HuggingFace or OpenLLM for free LLM model usage. OpenAI will be for moving PoCs (Proof of Concept) to actual projects!

The key focus for this month will be improving interviewing skills, as I can't keep feeling like each round is out of luck rather than practices (a slight shift in focus).

All the best coding,
